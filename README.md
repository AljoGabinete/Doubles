# Doubles

A clone of the popular 2048 game implemented using vanilla JavaScript and CSS. Use the arrow keys to move the tiles on the game board. When two tiles of the same number collide, they merge to form a new tile with their sum. The goal of the game is to reach the 2048 tile and achieve the highest score possible.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles in the corresponding direction.
3. Tiles with the same number will merge when they collide, forming a new tile with their sum.
4. After each move, a new tile (either 2 or 4) will appear on an empty spot on the board.
5. Continue merging tiles and strategizing your moves to reach the 2048 tile.
6. The game ends when there are no more valid moves available (i.e., the board is filled and no adjacent tiles can be merged).
7. Aim to achieve the highest score possible by reaching higher-numbered tiles.
